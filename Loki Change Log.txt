Things to do:
Player slows down when collecting pellets
Enemies slow down when going through tunnels (half speed like when frightened)

Add cherries and other methods of getting back lives or getting bonus score! (Check points on website table)

Add cornering where you can go around corners a few "pixels" before you reach the corner tile to perform diagonal movement that's essentially 2x speed

Increase music pitch to 1.2 and 1.4 in last <certain number> of pellets and then at half that amount, pitch even higher

Done things:
v1.3:
*Increased base player & enemies movement speed for more lively gameplay
*Fixed ghosts from entering a bugged state where they have no hitbox and are stuck at half speed if a Tesseract is picked up whilst the enemy is retreating to the TVA.
*Fixed bug where collecting another Tesseract whilst enemies were frightened didn't reset the frightened state timer.
*Catching frightened enemies now doubles the points awarded for each enemy caught after the first caught from the same Tesseract. Collecting a new Tesseract resets this mutliplier back to 1x (200 points awarded for next enemy caught).
v1.2:
+Added new an improved movement control with a 2-layered input queueing system.
+Added UI to display the current level.
*Fixed loki from losing a life everytime you complete a round.
*Fixed pausing game bugging whilst transitioning between death or rounds.
*Fixed high score saving to actually load in the hi-score value into memory, not just the text UI at the beginning of the game.
*Brightened the colour of frightened enemies to make them clearer to see.
*Fixed frightened enemies loop to now properly pause whilst the game is paused
