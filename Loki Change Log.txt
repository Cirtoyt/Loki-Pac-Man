Things to do:
Player slows down when collecting pellets (a minor speed thing)
Enemies slow down when going through tunnels (half speed like when frightened)

Make ghosts turn around when entering frightened mode and when switching between scatter/chase modes

If you catch all 4 ghosts with 1 teseract, at each teseract, you get a plus 12,000 points! This can happen once every level

Add cornering where you can go around corners a few "pixels" before you reach the corner tile to perform diagonal movement that's essentially 2x speed

Increase music pitch to 1.2 and 1.4 in last <certain number> of pellets and then at half that amount, pitch even higher
Increase music pitch to insane when in frighten mode
Increase music pitch to insane more so + reversed whilst any ghost is retreating to the TVA

Done things:
v1.4:
+Added variable speed multipliers to the player and ghosts depending if on level 1, 2 to 4, 5 to 20, or 21 onwards. Also, now the player gets quicker when getting the tesseract for the first 4 levels too.
+Added a mute sound button that has it's state saved to PlayerPrefs also!
+Added visualisation for the points scored from capturing ghosts that do a little rise animation too!
+Added the ability to gain back a life lost for every 10,000 points you score.
*Fixed a bug where if ghosts were in the middle of returning to the TVA when the frightened mode time runs out, they would instantly go back to chasing/scattering movement mode. Now they will complete their trip back home.
v1.3:
*Increased base player & enemies movement speed for more lively gameplay
*Fixed ghosts from entering a bugged state where they have no hitbox and are stuck at half speed if a Tesseract is picked up whilst the enemy is retreating to the TVA.
*Fixed bug where collecting another Tesseract whilst enemies were frightened didn't reset the frightened state timer.
*Catching frightened enemies now doubles the points awarded for each enemy caught after the first caught from the same Tesseract. Collecting a new Tesseract resets this mutliplier back to 1x (200 points awarded for next enemy caught).
v1.2:
+Added new an improved movement control with a 2-layered input queueing system.
+Added UI to display the current level.
*Fixed loki from losing a life everytime you complete a round.
*Fixed pausing game bugging whilst transitioning between death or rounds.
*Fixed high score saving to actually load in the hi-score value into memory, not just the text UI at the beginning of the game.
*Brightened the colour of frightened enemies to make them clearer to see.
*Fixed frightened enemies loop to now properly pause whilst the game is paused
