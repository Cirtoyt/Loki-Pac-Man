Things to do:
Add mouse mute button/input (maybe input to not clash with Unity eventsystem)

Player speeds up from completing levels & when energized
Player slows down when collecting pellets
Enemies speed up from completing levels
Enemies slow down when going through tunnels
(Check speeds on website table)

Visualise catch enemy points 200, 400, 800, 1600 etc over enemy on catch

Every 10,000 points, gain an extra life if there is space (original was only 1 extra life at 10,00 only, not repeating, and allowing having 4 lives total if you didn't lose a life before hand, so will have to decide how to handle endless lives (maybe next at 30,000? and then repeating every 20,000?) and max totaly of lives (3 or 4?))

Add cherries and other methods of getting back lives or getting bonus score! (Check points on website table)

Increase pitch to 1.2 and 1.4 in last <certain number> of pellets and at then half that amount

Done things:
v1.3:
*Increased base player & enemies movement speed for more lively gameplay
*Fixed ghosts from entering a bugged state where they have no hitbox and are stuck at half speed if a Tesseract is picked up whilst the enemy is retreating to the TVA.
*Fixed bug where collecting another Tesseract whilst enemies were frightened didn't reset the frightened state timer.
*Catching frightened enemies now doubles the points awarded for each enemy caught after the first caught from the same Tesseract. Collecting a new Tesseract resets this mutliplier back to 1x (200 points awarded for next enemy caught).
v1.2:
+Added new an improved movement control with a 2-layered input queueing system.
+Added UI to display the current level.
*Fixed loki from losing a life everytime you complete a round.
*Fixed pausing game bugging whilst transitioning between death or rounds.
*Fixed high score saving to actually load in the hi-score value into memory, not just the text UI at the beginning of the game.
*Brightened the colour of frightened enemies to make them clearer to see.
*Fixed frightened enemies loop to now properly pause whilst the game is paused
